The entire build procedure is defined in a shell script, available from:

  https://sourceforge.net/p/gnuarmeclipse/openocd/ci/gnuarmeclipse/tree/pkgbuild/build-openocd-osx.sh

The procedure requires the presence of MacPorts in the PATH:

  export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH

and the following MacPorts packages:

  sudo port install libtool automake autoconf pkgconfig libusb libusb-compat
  sudo port install texinfo texlive

To download the build script, use:

  curl -L https://sourceforge.net/p/gnuarmeclipse/openocd/ci/gnuarmeclipse/tree/pkgbuild/build-openocd-osx.sh?format=raw \
  -o ~/Downloads/build-openocd-osx.sh

After downloading the script, eventually adjust the WORK folder 
definition to a folder of your choice.

The output of the build script is a .pkg file in the ${WORK}/output folder.


Many thanks to my friend Dan Maiorescu for his major contributions 
to this project.
