The are the files required by [NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System)](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page).

* **gnuarmeclipse-openocd.nsi** is the script used by makensis to generate the Windows setups

* **openocd-nsis.ico** is the image used in left pane of the setup windows; it was selected because it contains a JTAG reference;

* **openocd-nsis.ico** is a generic debugger icon, and not the official OpenOCD icon, since... I could not find such an official icon.
