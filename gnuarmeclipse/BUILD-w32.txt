The entire build procedure is defined in a shell script, available from:

  https://sourceforge.net/p/gnuarmeclipse/openocd/ci/gnuarmeclipse/tree/gnuarmeclipse/build-openocd-w32-cross-debian.sh

To download the build script, use:

  wget https://sourceforge.net/p/gnuarmeclipse/openocd/ci/gnuarmeclipse/tree/gnuarmeclipse/build-openocd-w32-cross-debian.sh?format=raw \
  -O ~/Downloads/build-openocd-w32-cross-debian.sh

To execute the script:

  bash ~/Downloads/build-openocd-w32-cross-debian.sh

The output of the build script is a setup file in the ${OPENOCD_WORK}/output 
folder.

The script was developped on Debian x64. Running it on other GNU/Linux
distributions is possible, but might require some adjustments.

Many thanks to my friend Dan Maiorescu for his major contributions 
to this project.
