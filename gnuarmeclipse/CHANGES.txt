The following changes were applied to the OpenOCD master branch:

[2015-01-12]

- src/openocd.c

Add branding 'GNU ARM Eclipse' to the greeting message, to 
more easily identify this custom version.

- helper/options.c

Update the logic used to locate the 'scripts' folder, by 
using the argv[0], as on Windows. The logic is a bit more
complicated, to accomodate 3 cases (no path, relative path
and absolute path).
