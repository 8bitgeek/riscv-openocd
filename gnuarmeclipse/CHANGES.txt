The following changes were applied to the master branch:

[2015-01-12]

- src/openocd.c
add branding 'GNU ARM Eclipse' to the greeting message, to 
more easily identify this cusom version.

- helper/options.c
update the logic used to locate the 'scripts' folder, by 
using the argv[0], as on Windows. The logic is a bit more
complicated, to accomodate 3 cases (no path, relative path
and absolute path).
