This package was build on a Ubuntu x64 machine, using the script provided in

  GNU ARM Eclipse/build-openocd-win-cross-linux.sh

To run it, first be sure the the packages required in the Prerequisites 
section are installed, then copy the script and execute it with bash:

  bash build-openocd-win-cross-linux.sh

The output of the build script is a setup file in the Work/output folder.

To build the latest version of the package please use the script from:

  wget https://sourceforge.net/p/gnuarmeclipse/openocd/ci/gnuarmeclipse-dev/tree/gnuarmeclipse/scripts/build-openocd-win-cross-linux.sh?format=raw \
  -O ~/Downloads/build-openocd-win-cross-linux.sh

  bash ~/Downloads/build-openocd-win-cross-linux.sh

The script was developped on Ubuntu x64. Running it on other GNU/Linux
distributions is possible, but might require some adjustments.

Up-to-date build information is available in the GNU ARM Eclipse project wiki:

Many thanks to my friend Dan Maiorescu for his major contributions 
to this project.
