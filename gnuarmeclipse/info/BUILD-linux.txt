This package was build on a Debian x64 machine, using the script provided in

  gnuarmeclipse/build-openocd-debian.sh

To run it, first be sure the the packages required in the Prerequisites 
section are installed, then copy the script and execute it with bash:

  bash build-openocd-debian.sh

The output of the build script is .tgz file in the ${OPENOCD_WORK}/output 
folder.

To build the latest version of the package please use the script from:

  wget https://sourceforge.net/p/gnuarmeclipse/openocd/ci/gnuarmeclipse/tree/gnuarmeclipse/scripts/build-openocd-debian.sh?format=raw \
  -O ~/Downloads/build-openocd-debian.sh

  bash ~/Downloads/build-openocd-debian.sh

The script was developped on Debian x64. Running it on other GNU/Linux
distributions is possible, but might require some adjustments.

Up-to-date build informations are available in the GNU ARM Eclipse project wiki:

Many thanks to my friend Dan Maiorescu for his major contributions 
to this project.
