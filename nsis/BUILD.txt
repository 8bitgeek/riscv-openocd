The entire build procedure is defined in a shell script, available from:

  https://sourceforge.net/p/gnuarmeclipse/openocd/ci/gnuarmeclipse/tree/nsis/build-openocd-w32-cross-debian.sh

The procedure requires the presence of the following packages:

  sudo apt-get install git doxygen libtool autoconf automake texinfo texlive \
  autotools-dev pkg-config  mingw-w64 mingw-w64-tools mingw-w64-dev

To download the build script, use:

  wget https://sourceforge.net/p/gnuarmeclipse/openocd/ci/gnuarmeclipse/tree/nsis/build-openocd-w32-cross-debian.sh?format=raw \
  -O ~/Downloads/build-openocd-w32-cross-debian.sh

After downloading the script, eventually adjust the WORK folder 
definition to a folder of your choice.

The output of the build script is a setup file in the ${WORK}/output folder.


Many thanks to my friend Dan Maiorescu for his major contributions 
to this project.
